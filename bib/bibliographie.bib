  abstract   = {In this video, we introduce the concepts of data in motion and data at rest. We show how the Hazelcast platform sits at the junction of these two types of data to provide real-time data handling. We then describe an example of implementing Hazelcast.
                
                -------
                
                Hazelcast is empowering the world to act instantaneously on data everywhere. We are the home of the real-time data platform that enables enterprises to capture value at every moment. We provide a cloud-managed service that simplifies the development and deployment of real-time applications.
