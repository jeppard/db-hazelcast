In recent years, many areas have been changed by digitalisation. 
The digitalisation of areas has led to many changes and improvements. 
The possibilities of storing large amounts of data have become increasingly important. 
In 2020, a total of 64.2 zettabytes of data were generated in the world. 
Forecasts for 2025 expect this to increase to 181 zettabytes of data. 
In order to cope with these large amounts of data, new database management systems are constantly being developed and improved. 
However, rational databases such as MySQL are not suitable for storing this amount of data efficiently. 
For this reason, NoSQL database solutions are becoming increasingly important to deal with these data volumes. 
In this report, the Key-Value-Stores are analysed in more detail and explained using the example of Hazelcast. 
In the following section, the general concept of key-value databases is discussed. \parencite{data_development_2012_2025, Key_Value_Datastore}
