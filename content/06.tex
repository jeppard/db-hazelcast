\section{Conclusion and Recommendations}
Hazelcast is a database that can be used for a variety of different tasks. It offers scalability due to the cluster architecture, the streaming engine makes it viable for fast processing. Due to the default prioritization of availability over consistency, it is suited to handle high amounts of data, while also retaining the possibility of consistency through the CP-subsystem.\\
\\
Hazelcast especially excels in dynamic environments due to its built-in streaming engine that allows dynamic data to be evaluated and transformed in real-time. The variety of clients and connectors allows for a simple integration of Hazelcast in an application.\\
Due to the many features that Hazelcast offers, an initial solution built with Hazelcast can grow complex quickly and switching databases from Hazelcast to another provider is coupled with difficulties, because Hazelcast does not offer a direct exportation of data.\\
\\
In the future, NoSQL-databases are projected to rise in market size. Hazelcast will likely partake in this trend as a Multi-model database with a focus on Key-Value storage. The flexibility  to process dynamic data thorugh its streaming engine, as well as the integration of ML-Ops makes Hazelcast a unique database solution worth considering in the future.
